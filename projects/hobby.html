    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am Oscar, born in Costa Rica, I moved to San Francisco 11 years ago and since then <br>this city has not ceased to amaze me...one of the things that I thank the city the most <br>was getting together with many people from around the world with which it has allowed <br>me to play with very talented people who like me share the same love for music.
    </p>

    <h1>Why do I enjoy doing this hobby?</h1>

    <p>Music represents for me the greatest manifestation of joy that I can experience, as long as <br>I am playing an instrument and sharing with other sounds there will always be happiness <br>in me and in those around me.
    </P>

        <h2>What should you do if you want to get into music.</h2>
        <p>
            We are living in a world where things are cheap yet expensive. An initial investment is <br>a must if you want to learn something or take up something. <br>My recommendation to you is basically start with learning sheet music and see how seriously <br>and devotedly you are gonna continue it doing. This is quite helpful if you wanna learn any instrument. <br>If you quit within 2 weeks of time, you weren’t even serious about doing it and you should probably doze off.<br>

            And the reason why I am telling you this is because I stared playing first the instrument, <br>and years after I stared to learn how to read music, I can not do it in a really good way yet.
