ABOUT ME: 

I am Oscar, born in Costa Rica, I moved to San Francisco 11 years ago and since then this city has not ceased to amaze me...one of the things that I thank the city the most was getting together with many people from around the world with which it has allowed me to play with very talented people who like me share the same love for music.
