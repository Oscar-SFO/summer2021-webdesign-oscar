    <h1>CSS in Depth</h1>
<p>The main objective of this book titled “Enduring CSS” is to make the web developers write the CSS style <br>codes which are durable over a long period of time. <br>It is a guide to writing style sheets for large scale, <br>rapidly changing, long-lived web projects.
    It taught me how to individualize the styles so that those CSS modules become simpler to transport into <br>different contexts and projects. It imparts knowledge <br>on CSS tools such as PostCSS and linting tools to study <br>and maintain the CSS code base across the large project.</p>

    <h1>CSS Refactoring</h1>
<p>This book or a chapter of the book is mainly based on refactoring and scaling of the CSS codes. It imparts <br>
    knowledge on what actually refactoring means and its relation to software architecture. According to the book <br>
    “Refactoring is the process of rewriting code in order to make it more simple and reusable without changing its behavior “. <br>
    Now, we know that CSS styles can be made re-usable as well by making an external stylesheet.</p>
